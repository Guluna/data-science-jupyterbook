    "Hypothesis Testing is like making an educated guess about a situation. For instance, \"students at School X study for 2 hours every day.\" We then gather information to see if this guess holds true or not.\n",
    "- Null Hypothesis (H0): The statement we’re questioning. For example, \"students at School X do not study for 2 hours every day.\"\n",
    "- Alternative Hypothesis (HA): The statement we want to support. For example, \"students at School X study for 2 hours every day.\"\n",

    "T-test gives us two values: the t-statistic and the p-value. The bigger the t-statistic, the more difference there is between groups mean values. The p-value is the probability in favor of null hypothesis (i.e. probability that Null hypothesis is true given the data). If the p-value is less than 0.05, usually, we conclude that the difference is statistically significant and not due to randomness and thus it is safe to reject the null hypothesis."
